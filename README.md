# flutterdev
Flutter is a mobile app development framework created by Google. It uses the Dart programming language to build high-performance, high-fidelity apps for iOS and Android. To learn Flutter, you can start with the official documentation, tutorials, and sample apps. Once you have a basic understanding of the framework, you can start building your own simple application. This might involve creating a user interface using widgets, connecting to a back-end service to retrieve data, and handling user interactions. With Flutter's hot-reload feature, you can quickly see the changes you make to your code in the app, making the development process faster and more efficient.
